# CS319 MidTerm
Technical Summary

- TypeScript: Utilizes static typing for improved code quality.
- Functions: Includes higher-order functions (e.g., `createGradeMultiplier`) and utility functions (e.g., `calculateMedianGrade`).
- Asynchronous Programming: Uses `async/await` for handling asynchronous tasks, like in `fetchStudentData`.
- Array Methods: Employs `filter()` for grade filtering, `map()` for name extraction, and `reduce()` for counting total grades.
- Error Handling: Implements `try/catch` in `parseStudentData` to handle JSON parsing errors.
- Modularity: Organizes code into separate files for better maintainability.
- OOP Principles: The `Student` class encapsulates data and methods for grade calculations.
The code leverages TypeScript, functional programming, and OOP principles to create a robust, modular system for managing and calculating student data.
